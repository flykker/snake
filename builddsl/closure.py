class ClosureState(Target):
    """
    This class represents the state of a closure that is passed as the first argument, named `__closure__`, to
    a function defined by the BuildDSL closure syntax. Its purpose is to carry forth the context for every
    subsequently nested closure definition.

    To illustrate this, consider the following BuildDSL code:

    ```py
    project {
        task("b") {
            depends_on task("a")
        }
    }
    ```

    This code defines two closures, nested in each other. The transpiled code will look somewhat like this:

    ```py
    @__closure__.subclosure
    def _closure_1(__closure__, self, *args, **kwargs):
        @__closure__.subclosure
        def _closure_1_closure_2(__closure__, self, *args, **kwargs):
            __closure__["depends_on"](__closure__["task"]("a"))
        __closure__["task"](_closure_1_closure_2)
    ```

    As you can see, we build a hierarchy of :class:`ClosureState` objects by decorating each function definition
    that corresponds to a closure with the :meth:`subclosure` decorator. This allows us to dynamically resolve the
    names `depends_on` and `task` in a depth-first order when they are accessed in the inner-most closure.

    * `depends_on` is a member on `task("b")`
    * `task` is a memeber on `project`
